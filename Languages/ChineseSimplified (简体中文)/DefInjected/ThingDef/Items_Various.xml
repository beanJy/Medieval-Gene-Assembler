  <ArchiteCapsule.label>超凡灵药</ArchiteCapsule.label>
  <!-- EN: A small capsule containing archites - microscopic machines produced by a superintelligent archotech. These devices are capable of physical and psychic feats which seem impossible to human scientists. As with all archotechnology, no human can create one. We can only try to scavenge the ones that archotechs create for their own unfathomable reasons.\n\nThis capsule is useless by itself, but it can be spent at a gene assembler to create a new archite-powered xenogerm. This requires researching archogenetics and a genepack that contains an archite gene. Archite genepacks can be obtained from traders. -->
