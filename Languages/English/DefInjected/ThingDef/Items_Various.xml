  <ArchiteCapsule.label>Archite Potion</ArchiteCapsule.label>
  <!-- EN: A small capsule containing archites - microscopic machines produced by a superintelligent archotech. These devices are capable of physical and psychic feats which seem impossible to human scientists. As with all archotechnology, no human can create one. We can only try to scavenge the ones that archotechs create for their own unfathomable reasons.\n\nThis capsule is useless by itself, but it can be spent at a gene assembler to create a new archite-powered xenogerm. This requires researching archogenetics and a genepack that contains an archite gene. Archite genepacks can be obtained from traders. -->
  <ArchiteCapsule.description>A miraculous potion, extremely rare, can fuse with the Archite Soul Stone to create a powerful soul.</ArchiteCapsule.description>

  <!-- EN: A small capsule containing a package of genetic information. To use a genepack, it must be placed in a gene bank near a gene assembler and combined into an implantable xenogerm.\n\nIf not kept in a powered gene bank, this genepack will slowly deteriorate. -->
  <Genepack.description>A stone storing a small amount of soul. Placed in the Soul Altar for soul fusion.\n\nIf not kept in the Soul Altar, the Soul Stone will gradually deteriorate.</Genepack.description>
